# week-9-spring-2018

For the week 9 lab, I did not make it past milestone 1.  I downloaded the GCP SDK on my local machine, but I could not get it to run in the command prompt, on bash, or in anaconda. I created the google cloud account. I visited this webpage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads to find out how to initialize the SDK in windows, but the command provided did not work and I received an error messages amongst many attempts. I believe this problem to be because I have a windows computer, but I am unsure why the instructions provided by google cloud did not work for my laptop. Therefore, I could not make it past this point and was unable to get the lab working.
I also attempted to download the Cloud SDK Interactive Installer. At the very end of the install, it failed and said that I needed python. Then I got python and retried it and, but it still did not complete.
